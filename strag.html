        <h2>The importance of negotiations in the corporate offering</h2>
        <p class="sol-txt">Negotiations have become an integral part of corporate reality. A large part of
            intra-organizational or
            extra-organizational processes depend on various negotiation processes. </p>

            affect the organization's performance. Therefore,
            in today's reality, in order to move the organization forward,
            it is very important to develop negotiation capabilities among
            all those in the organization.</p>
        <p>There are two fundamental approaches to negotiations: competitive negotiations
            and integral negotiations.</p>

            <h3>Competitive negotiation</h3>
            <p> Competitive negotiation is an approach that holds that in every negotiation process both sides compete
                for a particular resource and if one side wins, then the other side inevitably loses. If one side gets
                more, then the other gets less. This approach would have access to controls until the 80s. Since the
                1980s, a fundamentally different approach has evolved that argues that one does not have to win or lose
                in negotiations. It is possible to create a reality in which everyone wins.
